# JokeAPI Project

This repository is a small project designed to practice testing methodologies and principles in ASP.NET Core while working on a Web API.
The project focuses on implementing clean, testable code and using tools like mocking and dependency injection to ensure robust and maintainable applications.

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to:

- Test Web API endpoints effectively using unit tests.
- Apply mocking to isolate and validate controller behaviors without relying on actual service implementations.
- Use dependency injection to create flexible and testable code.
- Practice test-driven development (TDD) by writing tests first and then implementing features to make them pass.
